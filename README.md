## How to run this in your pc?
[I am considering you know the basics of django and virtualenv before following these instructions]

* Create a virtualenv using `virtualenv djangoprojectenv`
* copy the the content of this repository in that folder.
* Run your env with `Source\activate`
* install the requirements in requirements.txt
* then run your server by `python manage.py runserver`
